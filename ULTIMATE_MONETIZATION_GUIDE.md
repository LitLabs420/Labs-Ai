## 📊 TIER STRUCTURE (Psychology-Optimized)

### The 8-Tier Strategy

```
FREE ($0)          → Loss leader, converts to Starter
STARTER ($29)      → Entry point, high conversion rate
CREATOR ($79)      → "Popular" tier, 2nd price point anchor
PRO ($199)         → Professional tier, jump in value
ELITE ($499)       → Prestige tier, attracts high-value users
AGENCY ($1,299)    → White-label, B2B revenue
ENTERPRISE ($3,999) → Large organizations
GOD ($9,999)       → Ultimate tier, custom everything
```

### Psychology Behind Pricing

| Strategy | Implementation | Result |
|----------|---|---|
| **Price Anchoring** | $9,999 God tier makes $199 Pro look cheap | Perception shift toward mid-tiers |
| **Prestige Pricing** | Elite/God tiers create aspirational value | FOMO drives upgrades from lower tiers |
| **Decoy Pricing** | Creator tier positioned between Starter/Pro | 70% select Creator (instead of 50/50 split) |
| **Annual Discount** | 25% off yearly billing | Higher LTV, better cash flow |
| **Value Stacking** | Show total features per tier | Perceived value increases 40% |
| **Scarcity** | "Only 15 Elite spots per quarter" | Creates urgency |
