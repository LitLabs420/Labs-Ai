# Time: 5 minutes to generate, 30 minutes to test
```

### Option B: Manual Step-by-Step (Recommended for Learning)
1. Read `ENHANCEMENT_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
2. Start with Phase 1: Foundation
3. Copy code examples from guide
4. Test each component individually
5. Move to Phase 2, 3, 4

**Time:** 4-6 weeks part-time

### Option C: Pick & Choose (Maximum Flexibility)
1. Review `PROJECT_ENHANCEMENT_AUDIT.md`
2. Identify top 5 priorities for your project
3. Implement just those features
4. Iterate based on user feedback

**Time:** 2-4 weeks part-time
