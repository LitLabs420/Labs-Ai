## DM SCRIPTS FOR NAIL TECHS

### When someone asks: "How long do acrylic nails last?"
```
Hey babe! Acrylics typically last 3-4 weeks. 

After that, you can either:
- Get a fill ($20-25) to extend them longer
- Or do a fresh full set ($55)

Most of my clients do fills for 2-3 months, then give their natural nails a break with a fresh set.

What's your style—acrylics, gels, or natural nails with design?
```

### When someone says: "I don't want them too long"
```
Perfect, that's honestly the healthier choice!

I do short acrylics all day. We go with a classic square or almond shape, keep the length conservative but still let you have that LOOK.

Short + cute > long + damaged any day of the week 💅

When can you come in?
```

### When someone is nervous about first appointment
```
First nail day jitters? Totally normal! Here's what happens:

1. You pick your design (I'll show you pics)
2. I prepare your nails (painless)
3. I apply extensions or design (you just relax, maybe scroll or chat)
4. Drying time (about 10-15 min)
5. You leave with FIRE nails

Takes about 60-90 min total. Zero pain, all vibes.

You're gonna love how they make you feel. Let's do it?
```

### When someone books but ghosts you
```
Hey babe! Had you down for 3pm tomorrow 🥺

Is everything okay? I totally understand if something came up—just let me know so I can open the slot for someone else.

If you still want to reschedule, I'm flexible. Just send me a quick message!
```

### When someone wants to know about gel vs acrylic
```
Real talk: They're different, and it depends on YOUR needs:

**Acrylics:** Longer-lasting, cheaper maintenance, but need fills more often ($20-25 fills)

**Gels:** Smoother feel, easier on nails long-term, but slightly pricier upfront and fills too ($30-35)

**My honest take:** If you're new, start with gel. If you want that long-lasting OOMPH, acrylics.

Either way, you're getting that look. When you trying it?
```

### When someone is worried about nail damage
```
I hear you—bad nail techs DO damage nails 😤

Here's how I protect your natural nails:

1. I use quality products (not cheap materials)
2. I prep properly (don't rush)
3. I keep extensions at healthy lengths
4. I remove gently (never rip them off)
5. I recommend breaks between sets

Your nails come FIRST. The extensions second.

Let me show you what real nail care looks like?
```

### When someone asks about removal
```
DO NOT remove them yourself!! 🚨

Ripping or peeling off acrylics = major damage to your natural nails.

Professional removal = I soak them, gently remove them, then give your natural nails a recovery treatment.

It's like $15-20 and worth EVERY penny for nail health.

Book your removal appointment with me?
```

### When someone leaves a great review
```
BABE YOU'RE AMAZING!! 😭💕

Seriously tho—reviews like this keep me going. Next time you're here, $10 credit on me.

See you for your fill! Nails gotta stay FRESH 💅
```
