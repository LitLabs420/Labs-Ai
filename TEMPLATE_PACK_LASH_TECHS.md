## DM SCRIPTS FOR LASH TECHS

### When someone asks: "How long do they last?"
```
Hey babe! Full lashes typically last 3-4 weeks, then you'll need a fill. 
Fills are $60-75 depending on how much we're refilling.
Your natural lash cycle determines everything though—some people's lashes shed faster.

What's your schedule looking like? Let's get you booked!
```

### When someone says: "I've had bad experiences with lash techs"
```
I hear you. SO many horror stories out there 😅

Here's my promise: I use premium products, I focus on lash health first, and if anything feels off after your appointment, we're fixing it FREE.

First lash experience with me = free replacement if you're not comfortable. Real talk.

When you free for a consultation?
```

### When someone is worried about cost
```
I get it—lashes aren't cheap. But think of it this way:

$150 for a lash set = lasts 3-4 weeks
That's like $40-50/week for that LOOK

Then fills are only $60, so you're maintaining that investment.

Versus: makeup every single day, constantly buying mascara, and still not looking this good?

We're actually saving you money 💰

Ready to try?
```

### When someone books but ghosts you
```
Hey babe! I had you down for 2pm tomorrow. Is everything okay? 

I totally understand if something came up. Just let me know so I can open the spot for someone else.

If you still want to reschedule, I got you. But just send a quick message back either way 💕
```

### When someone asks: "Can I get lashes on top of damaged ones?"
```
Short answer: No, and I won't do it.

Putting extensions on unhealthy lashes = more damage + they won't last + your natural lashes suffer.

Here's what we DO: Give your lashes 2-3 weeks to recover. Use my lash serum (I'm selling it for $15). 
Then we apply fresh lashes to healthy lashes = they stay longer + they look better.

Your lashes will THANK you long-term.

Want the serum + ready to book in 3 weeks?
```

### When someone wants to know your "technique"
```
I use the Flat+Cluster hybrid method with premium mink-grade synthetics. 

Translation: I'm applying multiple thinner lashes to create a full, fluffy look (that's "hybrid"), and I'm using the best materials so they last longer and feel lighter on your natural lashes.

You'll see the difference immediately. Promise 🔥

Book now?
```

### When someone is nervous about first appointment
```
First lash anxiety is REAL and totally valid. Here's what happens:

1. We chat about your lash goals (natural, dramatic, somewhere in between)
2. I explain everything step-by-step so you know what's happening
3. It takes 90-120 min and you just chill with music + relax
4. You leave with lashes you'll actually get compliments on
5. Zero pain, just relaxation

You're gonna be obsessed. Let's make it official?
```

### When someone cancels last-minute
```
No worries at all babe! 

I know life happens. Just for future reference, 24-hour notice saves my whole day.

When you thinking you can come in next? I'll lock you in + we're good 💕
```

### When someone leaves a 5-star review
```
OMG babe you're TOO SWEET! 😭💕

Seriously though—y'all keep me motivated. Next time you're here, your service is $10 off. Loyalty hits different.

See you in 3 weeks for your fill!
```
