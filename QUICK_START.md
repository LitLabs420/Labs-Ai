## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

This guide gets you running locally in 5 minutes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)
- Git

### Step 1: Get API Keys (2 min)

You need these keys for the app to function:

- **Google Gemini**: For AI content generation.
- **Stripe**: For payment processing.
- **Firebase**: For authentication and database.

It's okay if you don't have them yet. The app will run, but some features will be disabled.

### Step 2: Clone & Install (1 min)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LitLabs/Labs-Ai.git
cd Labs-Ai
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment (1 min)

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Step 4: Run the App (1 min)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You should see the LitLabs AI homepage.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Problem**: `npm install` fails.
**Solution**: Make sure you have Node.js 18+ installed.

**Problem**: App crashes on startup.
**Solution**: Check that `.env.local` exists and is configured correctly.

**Problem**: AI features don't work.
